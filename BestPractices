Best Practices:

    1): Sanitize variables when ever you can for type safety.

        1): Check types when assuming information.

        2): Sanitize incoming arguments in functions.

        3): Sanitize io.read() to what you need always.


    2): Keep "Modules" mostly self contained for their own functionality.

        1): Keeping "Modules" mostly self contained means
            not having more than 1-4 other modules required.

        2): If you need to include more than 1-4 modules
            then your not writing a module your writing a library.

        3): Exceding the intended use of a module is
            bad practice avoid it if at all possible.

    3): Naming variables

        1): Module tables will be lowercase for convienence

        2): Constants like pi will be all caps

        3): For multiple words you shall use CammelCase

    3): Naming functions:
