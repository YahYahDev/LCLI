Best Practices:


    1): Sanitize variables when ever you can for type safety.

        1): Check types when assuming information

        2): Sanitize incoming arguments in functions

        3): Sanitize io.read() to what you need always


    2): Keep "Modules" mostly self contained for their own functionality

        1): Keeping "Modules" mostly self contained means
            not having more than 1-4 other modules required

        2): If you need to include more than 1-4 modules
            then your not writing a module your writing a library

        3): Exceding the intended use of a module is
            bad practice avoid it if at all possible


    3): Naming variables

        1): Module tables will be lowercase for convienence

        2): Constants like PI will be all caps

        3): For multiple words you shall use CammelCase


    3): Functions:

        1): Keep functions relativly simple, if you can
            express your function as a psudo code expression
            your good


    4): Documentation
        1): Document every function with "---" notation from the lsp

        2): Document "Modules" so that you know what they are used for

        3): If your "Module" or "Data Structure" is very complex then
            make a graph to show how it works in a high level way


    5): File Structure

        1):
